First you have to implement some helper functions (```smooth_image```, ```image_gradient```, ```compute_structure_tensor_Q```, ```compute_harris_score```, ```non_maximum_suppression```, ```compute_angles```). Finally you detect keypoints by implementing the function ```detect_corner_keypoints``` (and call your implemented helper functions from there). It is supposed to be a function that takes an image and some hyperparameters as inputs and returns a list of coordinates describing the location of detected key points. Furthermore, the orientation of the key point shall be returned. For key point detection you should apply the Harris detector to the image as dicussed in the lecture. For key point orientation, you should return the angle of the local gradient at each detected key point. The angle is important so that corresponding key points from differently rotated view points can be aligned. Hint: Use np.arctan2(x,y) for angle computation to get full 360 degree orientation."

    "\n",
    "There are different options to utilize the patch information and transform them into a feature representation. An intuitive approach is to compare the images by their color or color histograms. Yet, this reduces the robustness of our method to changes in lighting. Instead, we use image gradients as motivated in the [SIFT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94) paper and in the lecture.\n",

    "To implement this descriptor you may reuse most of your code from the `extract_patches` method in the previous section. You again extract patches but this time not from the grayscale image but from the gradient images, i. e., the gradient image in $x$ and $y$ direction. Afterwards, you compute the gradient length and orientation for every pixel in the patch. The gradient magnitudes are weighted by a gaussian kernel of the same size as the patch and $\\sigma=0.5 \\cdot patch size$. Finally, the patch is separated into a 4x4 grid where each cell consists of an 4x4 pixels subpatch. For each of these subpatches an 8-bin histogram is computed over the orientations of the gradients in that cell. For example, all gradients with orientation between 0 - 45 degrees are counted in the first histogram bin. All gradients with orientation between 45-90 in the second and so on. Instead of increasing the counter by one for each gradient, we increase it by the weighted magnitude. In total, we have eight counts per cell and 16 cells in total which results in a 128-dimenstional feature vector which we will use to describe the keypoint. In the end, this feature vector shall be nomalized to unit length.\n",

There are sophisticated matching algorithms which avoid checking every key point from one view with the one from another view. However, for the sake of this exercise comparing all key points is our way to go. As we encoded the appearance of each key point by a feature vector, we can easily compute its sum of squared differences to all other feature vectors.\n",

A simple method to do so is a ratio test.
